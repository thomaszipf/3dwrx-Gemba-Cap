# 3dwrx-gemba-cap

## The purpose of 3dwrx-gemba-cap
The inspiration behind this design is solution to the situation that we all had to face during COVID 19.
With 3dwrx-gemba-cap the staff that is working in production is able to do their GEMBA walks even if they are not phisically at the facility. Additionally, it can be used when technical guidance from a remote location is needed and traveling between locations is not possible or it is too expensive.
The 3dwrx-gemba-cap uses a sliding mechanism that is supported by a spring to hold the smartphone in place.
The whole mechanism is installed on a bump cap to ensure the employees protection and enable usage in safety relevant areas such as robot cells.

## What are the core features?
* holds smartphone in “action cam” position
* hands-free solution
* supports motion videos
* optimized to print
* combined with a safety cap usually used in production enviroments (example: UVEX U-Cap Premium cover)
* useful in complex production environments such as within industrialized production cells.
* assembly time: 5 Minutes

## How to setup:
Place the part in “native” usage position, the way that the slider stands 90°. This way, the slider will not attach to the part. PLA for printing is fine and will work. Infill of 20% is enough but can be adjusted according to your needs.
Please note: You will need an additional 7,5mm Diameter / approx.: 40mm long spring with a steel diameter of ca. 1mm. You probably need to test with this a bit.
After printing and using basic supports, the spring will be pushed through the hole at the backside of the part. Make sure, you do not have supports inside the “chamber” where the spring is located. This will not be possible to be removed but will for most printers also not be necessary.
Finally, you need to assemble the mount to the cap itself. As noted, we tested the mount to be compliant to UVEX U-Cap. Ordering one of them will probably provide the best overall experience. Other caps might need other angles / rounding to fit the geometry.
The mount will ideally be attached by M3 Hook and loop tape.
The connection at the configuration we used showed to be reliable and stable enough for the Use Case.

## Disclaimer:
However, since most of the application is depending on the assembly, the chosen components other then the mount, the level of adjustment from your side, the print settings as well as the particular environment you want to use the solution, it might be good to take it with a grain of salt. I‘m not granting any warranty nor taking any responsibility for this solution to work in your case. Please check upon using if the solution can work for you in your particular use case following own steps for qualification such as checking the setup and components before using and considering and checking own laws and regulations before bringing the solution into action.
